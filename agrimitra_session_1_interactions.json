    "final_response": "**What\u2019s happening?**  \nYour tomatoes are showing the classic signs of **Tomato Yellow Leaf Spot** caused by *Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato*. The disease starts as small, water\u2011soaked yellow spots that can merge into larger lesions, often spreading quickly if conditions are right (high humidity, poor airflow, or wet foliage).\n\n---\n\n## Quick\u2011Start Action Plan (24\u201348\u202fh)\n\n| Step | What to Do | Why It Helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1. Inspect & Prune** | Remove all infected leaves and any that are turning yellow or brown. Cut at least 1\u202fin. below the healthy tissue. | Cuts off the bacteria\u2019s food source and reduces inoculum. |\n| **2. Improve Air Circulation** | Thin out crowded plants, prune lower leaves, and space rows 18\u201324\u202fin. apart. | Dry leaves faster \u2192 less favorable for bacterial growth. |\n| **3. Water Wisely** | Water at the soil level in the morning; avoid overhead sprinklers. | Keeps foliage dry and limits splash\u2011dispersal of bacteria. |\n| **4. Sanitize Tools** | Disinfect pruning shears with 10\u202f% bleach or 70\u202f% alcohol after each cut. | Prevents spreading the pathogen between plants. |\n| **5. Apply a Copper\u2011Based Bactericide** | If available, mix 1\u202ftsp of copper sulfate (or 1\u202foz of copper oxychloride) in 1\u202fqt of water and spray until foliage is wet. Repeat every 7\u201310\u202fdays. | Copper is the most common, inexpensive option for bacterial leaf spot. |\n| **6. Use Resistant Varieties** | For future plantings, choose cultivars labeled \u201cbacterial leaf spot resistant\u201d (e.g., \u2018Roma\u2019, \u2018San Marzano\u2019, or newer hybrids). | Genetic resistance is the most sustainable long\u2011term solution. |\n| **7. Monitor & Record** | Check plants daily for new spots. Keep a simple log (date, symptoms, treatment). | Helps you spot trends and adjust tactics early. |\n\n---\n\n## If You Need More Help\n\n- **Local Extension or Agronomist** \u2013 They can confirm the diagnosis and recommend region\u2011specific bactericides or resistant varieties.\n- **Community Forums** \u2013 Share photos on local farming groups or online forums; often other growers have practical tips for your climate.\n\n---\n\n## Fertilizer Shop Note\n\nThe disease agent didn\u2019t return any nearby fertilizer shops. If you need a copper product or other supplies, try:\n\n1. Expanding your search radius (e.g., 10\u202fmi instead of 5\u202fmi).  \n2. Checking larger garden centers or agricultural supply stores in nearby towns.  \n3. Calling local nurseries to ask if they carry copper bactericides or resistant tomato seeds.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nAct fast\u2014remove infected leaves, improve airflow, and apply a copper spray. Keep the plants dry and monitor closely. If the problem persists or worsens, reach out to a local expert for a tailored solution. Good luck, and your tomatoes will thank you for the early intervention!",
